In order to get this project fully functional, clone the GitHub repository, or download the zip file.

1. Expand the zip file in your desired directory.
2. Download node if it isn’t already installed on your computer.
3. Navigate to the home folder of the decompressed file or local GitHub copy.
4. Run “npm install -g expo-cli” in terminal.
5. Run “npm install” in terminal to install all of the necessary dependencies.
6. Run “expo start”. This should start a development server serving our application. 
7. Type “i" into the terminal that is serving the application. This will start up an iOS simulator (which should be installed on the computer before running this server, which can be done by downloading Xcode from the App Store).
8. If you don’t have the simulator, you will be prompted to download additional components from Xcode, which will include the simulator.
9. If everything is successful after pressing “i”,  a simulator will pop up and display the application.

There are many known issues that come with setting up this environment that are not related to the functionality of our application. It will be easiest to install and run our application on a Mac that already has these tools and environments set up.
